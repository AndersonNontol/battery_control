/*	The GPIO 14  is the input pin that will be used to simulate a button. It can be configured to pull
	or pull down.	I will configure this pin to pull down. So by default it will have 0V.
	If the button is pressed the input will measure 3.3 V. The voltage used as a 3.3 V source will be
	supplied from the ESP32 itself.

	I will read the information on the button at regular intervals.
	If the logic level stays on 0V then the ESP32 will not wake up
	If the voltage ever rises to 5V (that means that the button was pressed) the ESP32 will go to active
