/*	The GPIO 0 is the input that will be measured. It is in pull up state by default
	I will read the information on the button at regular intervals.
	If the logic level stays on 5V then the ESP32 will not wake up
	If the voltage ever drops to 0V (that means that the button was pressed) the ESP32 will go to active
